## stuff to build

### get & set a tuple/record in memory

- takes a pointer to memory
- write a tuple to memory
- read a tuple from memory

### a typedef is an array of bytes

- each byte is a number representing a simple type
- need a create typedef
  - takes a pointer to mem
  - takes a length
  - takes a series of numbers representing types
  - composite types?
  - pointer to typedef could be its type
    - therefore numbers below a number could be builtins

### simple closure

### simple memory allocator

- bump allocator
- buddy allocator
